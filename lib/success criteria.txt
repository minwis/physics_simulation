1. The client should be able to observe particles moving in gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields.
2. The client should be able to add a new particle that behaves independently of other particles and has customizable initial values. 
3. The client should be able to see how the values of each particle change over time. 
4. The client should be able to see the static variables of the simulation’s system.
5. The client should be able to stop and resume the simulation.
6. The client should be able to adjust values from particles and the system.
7. The client should be able to reset the simulation to remove all existing particles and set the time to zero, thereby starting the simulation.
