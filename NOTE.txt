Either option A or option B.


Types of Forces
1. Magnetic Force ==> Calculate with Boris Pusher
2. Electric Force ==> Calculate with Verlet Integration
3. Applied Force ==> Calculate with Verlet Integration
4. Gravitational Force ==> Calculate with Verlet Integration



Option A — Put all non-magnetic forces in Boris’s half-step kicks
Elastic force (Hooke’s law, 
−
𝑘
𝑥
−kx),

Applied force (constant or time-varying push),

Gravity, electric, drag
→ all go into the half-step kicks around the magnetic rotation.

Why?

Keeps everything second-order accurate and time-centered.

This is the “classic” generalized Boris approach I mentioned earlier.

Drag is still easy to include here as an explicit term (no post-step needed).

Option B — Post-Boris corrections for forces that are easier to apply separately
Use Boris for E + B + gravity + elastic (forces that benefit from time-centering).

Then apply drag and any “instant” applied force after Boris finishes the step.

Why?

Keeps Boris’s structure clean.

Drag can be integrated with its own best method (e.g., exact exponential for linear drag).

If an “applied force” is more like an impulse (kick), it’s natural to add it after Boris.
